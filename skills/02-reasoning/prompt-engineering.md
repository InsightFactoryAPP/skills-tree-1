# Prompt Engineering

## Description

Prompt Engineering is the disciplined design and refinement of model instructions. A production prompt should make the task objective explicit, constrain important behavior, provide the context the model needs, and define an output contract that downstream code can validate.

## When to Use

- A model must follow a repeatable task contract.
- Output quality depends on explicit context or constraints.
- A workflow needs structured output that can be validated automatically.
- You need to compare prompt variants using a repeatable evaluation set.

## Inputs / Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | `str` | Objective the model must complete |
| `context` | `str` | Relevant facts, examples, or retrieved material |
| `constraints` | `list[str]` | Explicit behavioral or formatting constraints |
| `output_schema` | `dict` | Expected machine-readable output contract |
| → `prompt` | `str` | Complete model instruction |

## Minimal Runnable Pattern

```python
def build_prompt(task, context, constraints):
    instructions = f"Task: {task}\nContext: {context}"
    return f"{instructions}\nConstraints: {'; '.join(constraints)}"
```

## Core Practices

1. State the objective before implementation details.
2. Separate trusted context from instructions.
3. Make constraints explicit rather than relying on implied behavior.
4. Define structured outputs with a schema when software consumes the result.
5. Use representative evaluation cases before accepting a prompt change.
6. Keep prompts versioned when prompt behavior is part of a production contract.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Ambiguous output | Objective or schema is underspecified | Add explicit output requirements |
| Instruction conflict | Multiple requirements have unclear precedence | Define precedence and constraints explicitly |
| Prompt regression | Changes are not evaluated consistently | Maintain a deterministic evaluation set |
| Context overload | Too much irrelevant context | Retrieve or summarize only task-relevant context |
